# My Startup Website
## The Pitch: 
### On my mission in Brazil, we would frqeuntly face a common problem with the people we were helping. As we taught them the importance of marriage, they would tell us that they didn't know how or what to do to get married. 
### Looking back, in most of these South American countries the marriage process is often complicated and difficult. It often involved a lot of documents, legal visits, and in the end a regional judge had to "approve" the wedding. Throughout my mission, I would have liked some tool to help or teach people on what they need to do to go through the marriage process. 
### As a result, I plan on creating this site, (I haven't figured out a name yet) to try to help with the marriage process. This site could allow a user to learn what documents are necessary for the marriage process (in Brazil) and then fill out the right documents and know what to expect in the marriage legal process. (probably will have to be in Portuguese w/ translation in spanish)

## Key Features and technologies: 
### Authentication: The site will feature a generic login to save users information and secure their personal info. 
### Database data: This is a key part of the web site, it should be able to store user info like marriage documents in order to verify if they're correct. 
### WebSocket Data: This is also important, the site should be able to verify if submitted documents are properly filled. There could also be a real time chat to talk to an operator for help. 

### HTML: Used for text and overall layout of the website
### CSS: Used for the style and overall form of the website.
### JavaScript: Used for user interaction and storing info.

### Build update 11/11/23: Added endpoint connecting random image generator in the main page+about page. Also added chat link to the pop-up chat which uses Node.js and Socket.io (realtime service).
### In progress 11/13/23: Make website look better and chat more useable by coonnecting username and more security features (make active rooms with keys or codes).
